            <p>I am a Junior-year student at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am currently studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Most of my professional experience comes from internship work for Cummins in diesel engine emissions control, and I am returning this summer to pursue new projects.</p>
            <p>I currently live with my parents and sister in Ohio, and I plan to find work in the area after graduation. What little free time I have is mostly dedicated to video games</p>
